# Snake-Game
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The player uses the arrow keys to control a circle, square, or object on a bordered window (canvas). As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake starts with a specific length, so there is a moving tail with a fixed number of units away from the head. When the snake “eats” an item (food) that was randomly placed on the board, the snake grows by one unit, and a new food item is randomly positioned on the board as the snake keeps moving.
The player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake grow one unit longer, so controlling the snake is progressively more difficult. The player loses when the snake runs into the board boundaries or itself. Also, the game ends when the screen is completely filled with snake elements, i.e. the snake is not able to move any more.

Here, snake is an interactive game for one player and this code implements the game in Python using Processing. Processing is a free and open source software that can run on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. It is used as a flexible software sketchbook and to teach programming fundamentals within a visual context. It has also evolved into a development tool for professionals. More information at: https://processing.org/
